/broad/rosenlab_active/linus/Data/Paper/Neurons  folder:

Allneuron_PC31_cluster_markers.txt   : find.marke by batch and by final cluster  and dendrogram of cluster relationships
Allneuron_PC31_clusters_UMI_nGenes.txt  :    nGene, UMI data
Allneuron_PC31_node_markers.txt  :  find.node.markers for all nodes
Allneuron_clean.Robj: all neurons with identity assigned to cluster
NeuronData.txt : massive tab-delimited file with log normalized values for all genes and cells.  top row is cell name and 2nd row is cluster.  This is a huge file and may crash excel... but can be useful for making your individual cell heat maps?
NeuronData_average.txt: same as above, just averaged signal for each cluster (This is what we can use to make expression heat maps)
Also in unix, really easy and fast to obtain a single line of data for a gene you're interested without having to go into R etc.  as follows: grep "Agrp"  NeuronData_average.txt

John, I've also generated files for Chow vs. HFD comparisons for each cluster (both all cell and neuron clusters) in a HFDvChow subfolder in Allcell and Neuron folders.  There is one generated doing simple t-test... the other uses likelihood ratio testing provided by Seurat.  Each should be ranked by p-value, but I removed any thresholding so you can sort by fold expression change.  given inherent variability of single cell and still low numbers of HFD and chow cells, unlikely to get lots of significant changes, but might be worth it to do some gene set enrichment analyses on top changes (regardless if they're statistically significant) within specific cell types...
